CSULB DEGREE PLANNER ("Planify")
============================================================================================================

Project Description: 

  This web app is designed to simplify the process of planning for your degree. 
  Depending on what major you are in. 
  
  We streamline your degree progress allowing you to see what classes you still need to take.
  We help you calculate your raw GPA which also allows you to plan out how future progress in 
  subsequent classes will affect your overall GPA. 
  
  We also have a drag-drop feature that will literally help you plan out visually what courses you still
  have to take allowing you to place classes in future semesters and then updates your total unit count and 
  course specific unit count. 
  
==============================================================================================================

Methodology: 

  To use the web app you must first select you major from the drop down menu. We have the web app set for just 
  Computer Science majors at CSULB. Once you have selected your major and your catalog year you will be redirected
  to the "main.html" which will dynamically allocate the appropriate classes for your major to the page. 
  
  Once classes are loaded you can go ahead and click the classes you have taken with the grade you received for 
  the class. If all you need to do is calculate your GPA then if you scroll down and click on the "Calculate"
  button and underneath you will see your raw gpa score. This is done by adding an .click() to the calc button. 
  
  This drive the GPA calculation methods when the button is clicked. We add all ".input-group" to an array then 
  we iterate the array mapping all elements wth the ".form-control" class and its value (grades). 
  
  As we iterate through the array any ".form-control" (class) and grade returns 1 allowing our App to know that has
  a value if it has nothing in there it returns a 0 which lets our app that that class is yet to be taken. 
  
  To handle validation we return anything that doesnt fit in our conditions as a 0. The user is able to enter: 
  {"A","a","4","B","b","3","C","c","2","D","d","1","F","f","0"} these scores are parsed to integers and included
  in the raw gpa score calculation. This also allows the user to see how their GPA will be affected by predicted
  performance in future classes.
  
  The plan button was created to give the user a better visual representation of their degree over the course of the
  years they plan to be at the university. Once the user clicks the plan button they will be directed to the 
  plan.html page that show the user their total unit count and allows them to drag and drop their classes into their
  preferred semester with each drap updating the associate class type unit couunt
